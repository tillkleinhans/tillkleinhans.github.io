        <h1>Market-testing a cloud venture idea</h1>
    </span>
</div>
<!--<p class="description nda">(This project is under NDA, its content is generalized)</p>-->
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>In this short 12-week project, an energy corporation asked us to validate a venture idea in the cloud computing industry: Senior stakeholders were facing too much uncertainty in the idea's desirability and viability to make an investment decision.</p>
<p>My colleague Eva (lead business consultant) and I worked together with the client's project lead, who was pushing the idea internally for multiple years already.</p>
<h2>The idea: Sustainable cloud computing</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to power energy-intensive cloud computing services directly with energy from our own wind and solar parks and sell it to other businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Market context: Isn't the competition too strong?</h3>
<p>The competition in the cloud market is indeed very strong, as 70% of it is dominated by the three hyperscalers AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google <a href="https://corporate.ovhcloud.com/asia/europe-cloud-challenges-key-and-five-scenarios-impact/">[1]</a>. But the rational is: Even a little share of a <strong>TODO: market size in bn. €</strong> market ([2]&lt;- link here) is attractive to run a successful business in.</p>
<h2>Translated into hypotheses:</h2>
<ol>
<li>We can convince customers with our sustainability value proposition to buy our cloud service (→ Desirability)</li>
<li>We can offer this service for an attractive price (→ Viability)</li>
<li>We are capable to provide this service (→ Feasibility)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Desirability</h3>
<p>The client conducted qualitative interviews with hypothetical questions (&quot;would you buy XYZ&quot;) before. We chose a fake door test to validate if customers would buy the intended offering. This way, we could get unbiased results from real customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>My focus</li>
</ul>
<h3>Viability</h3>
<ul>
<li>What: What is the required investment, when can we expect to break even, what is the financial risk?</li>
<li>Existing calculation by project lead: Back-of-the-envelope estimation, tech costs detailed through partnering, but missing operational costs</li>
<li>This calculation should be deeper</li>
<li>Investment scenarios: Start with full RZ, half-full RZ x different hardware</li>
<li>Eva &amp; external expert</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feasibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech partnering already covered, focus of project lead, not part of this project</li>
<li>Parallel auf Client-Seite: Abteilung finden, die investiert &lt;- strategischer Fit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>To start this project, we had to understand what exactly we are offering, what competition we had to differentiate ourself from, and who are we selling to.</p>
<h2>IaaS: Not all clouds are the same</h2>
<p>Do you know what Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is? It is a cloud service model that other models build on top of in the cloud stack:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Physical data centers, minus the servers</li>
<li>Infrastructure-aaS: Physical servers, plus virtualization software</li>
<li>Platform-aaS: Development software (e.g. Kubernetes, databases)</li>
<li>Software-aaS: User software-as-a-Service (e.g. Slack, Microsoft Teams)</li>
</ol>
<p>IaaS was what the project lead was aiming for, supplemented with a few PaaS add-ons that the technical partners could provide.</p>
<h3>Competitors and their value propositions</h3>
<p>TODO: Venn diagram of value propositions</p>
<p>The project lead focused on sustainability and high-power computing as value propositions.</p>
<h4>Sustainability</h4>
<p>Everyone talks about sustainability, hyperscalers and non-hyperscalers. There is a difference between green energy through compensation with certificates and direct use of green energy, but we have to see how important this differentiation is for customers. Also, there are competitors that focus on sustainability holistically, with using second hand hardware and farming algaes with the excess server heat.</p>
<h4>High-power computing</h4>
<p>Average powered cloud infrastructure is sufficient for most current use cases. Other cases like artificial intelligence (AI) or high-performance computing (HPI) require more power, and there are a few competitors that focus on these cases.</p>
<h4>Additionally: EU-sovereignity</h4>
<p>My colleague Eva identified an additional focus in our competitors' value propositions: EU-sovereignity. It's relevant because of GDPR requirements.</p>
<h2>Customer segments for &quot;Ansprache&quot;</h2>
<p>Create customer segments to whom the USPs should be relevant</p>
<ul>
<li>Public sector &amp; suppliers → EU sovereignty: High requirements for GDPR compliance</li>
<li>Highly confidential industries (e.g. automotive, pharma) → EU sovereignty: No data on foreign servers, High-power: Energy-intense processing (e.g. CFD)</li>
<li>Other cloud-service providers (as whitelabel IaaS) → Differentiate their offering</li>
</ul>
<h2>Experiment design</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img-experiment-design.jpg" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<ul>
<li>Test 2 unique value propositions → 2 different ads, subpages for more info</li>
<li>Test 3 cloud computing offerings (= different hardware that needs to be bought)</li>
<li>Form in the end, 2 versions for 2 different segments</li>
<li>What to measure: Path through site, CTRs for the ads</li>
<li>Success: 3 letters of intent (LOI)</li>
</ul>
<h5><em>Include images:</em></h5>
<ol>
<li>Wireframes – gesamter Flow</li>
<li>(Wireframe sections? Ads → Website, Website + Unterseiten + Formular, Calendly &amp; weiterer Prozess)</li>
</ol>
<h2>UI / website design</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img-brand-chart.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<ul>
<li>Brand → Font, visual design</li>
<li>Very short time, 2 weeks → Focus on most important elements, prototype the rest</li>
<li>Limited visual assets = hi-res energy infrastructure photos → amend with dot patterns, isometric illustrations, icons to create consistent brand</li>
</ul>
<h5><em>Include images:</em></h5>
<ol>
<li>Brand Koordinatensystem + positioning</li>
<li>Visual elements: hi-res photos + isometric illustrations, icons + dot pattern to connect &amp; create coherent visual appearance</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results &amp; interpretation</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 contact form submits, 0 qualified / answering</li>
<li>(can I find the funnel?) 3000-4000 € budget? 100k impressions? 90-120 visits? Was stimmt hier nicht?</li>
<li>Ergebnis klar negativ, user paths / flows nicht ausgewertet</li>
<li>Hypothese falscher Kanal statt undesirable offering → Qual. interviews auf Fachmesse → Nicht desirable, nicht unique ggü. competition</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pivot</h2>
<ul>
<li>Colocation statt IaaS → viel leichtere Competition da keine Hyperscalers, näher an eigener Kompetenz (Energiekonzern)</li>
<li>Durch co-created experiment &amp; Ergebnisse buy-in from client project lead</li>
</ul>
