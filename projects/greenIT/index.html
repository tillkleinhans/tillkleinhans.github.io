        <h1>Market-testing a cloud venture idea</h1>
    </span>
</div>
<!--<p class="description nda">(This project is under NDA, its content is generalized)</p>-->
<h2>From wind parks to data centers</h2>
<p>In this 12-week project, a German energy corporation asked us to validate an ambitious venture idea:</p>
<p class="text-highlight"><span>Powering energy-intensive cloud computing services directly with energy from their own wind and solar parks, and selling them to other businesses.</span></p>
<p>The venture idea's lead was pushing for an investment, while the other stakeholders saw too much uncertainty. Eva (lead innovation consultant) and I were brought in to enable a decision.</p>
<h2>Big market, strong competition</h2>
<p>70-90% of the 100 Bn. € European cloud market is dominated by the seemingly invincible hyperscalers AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. But the outlook that only 1% of the non-hyperscaler market are worth 100 Mio. €, was a sufficient perspective to pursue this opportunity.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/market-size.png" alt="Diagram showing the size of the European public cloud market (100 Bn. €), the non-hyperscaler market (10 Bn. €) and 0,1% of the whole market (100 Mio. €)"></p>
<p class="img-description">1% of the non-hyperscaler market is worth 100 Mio. €</p>
<h2>Hypotheses &amp; alignment on a goal</h2>
<p>In order to be successful, the venture idea needed to fulfill the following 3 high-level hypotheses:</p>
<h4>1. Feasible: We are capable to provide this service</h4>
<p>Not in the project's scope, as the venture idea's lead explored the idea's feasibility in depth before this project.</p>
<h4>2. Viable: We can offer this service for an attractive price</h4>
<p>To validate this element, Eva collaborated with an external business analyst to calculate a business case with different scenarios.</p>
<h4>3. Desirable: We can convince customers to buy the cloud service</h4>
<p>To validate this element, we conducted a fake door test: We created a landing page prototype to test how attractive the service would be to real prospects.</p>
<h3>The goal: 3 letters of intent</h3>
<p>In the project kickoff, we agreed with our stakeholders on the goal of 3 customer letters of intent (LOI): If we managed to get 3 customers declaring their purchase interest in a LOI, we would perceive the desirability to be validated.</p>
<h2>Research: Who is buying, and why?</h2>
<p>To use the right keywords in our test, we researched which value propositions our competitors used to market their cloud services. While competitors used 1 or a combination of 2 of the values sustainability, high performance, and EU-sovereignty, the combination of the 3 values was an unoccupied positioning.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/value-propositions.png" alt="Venn diagram with 3 circles for the value propositions, plus company logos occupying the areas: Sustainable (windcloud, windCORES), EU-sovereign (IONOS, STACKIT, Telekom), Powerful (HP Enterprise) – and the combinations: Sustainable &amp; EU-sovereign (OVHcloud), Sustainable &amp; powerful (Cloud+Heat), EU-sovereign &amp; powerful (ORACLE). The middle of the venn diagram shows a gap."></p>
<p class="img-description">A combination of 3 value propositions gives a niche in the market</p>
<h4>Customer segments &amp; buyer profiles</h4>
<p>To target the right people with our advertisement budget, we developed a rough set of customer segments and buyer profiles, using a combination of desk research and the project lead's experience from interaction with prospects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer segments: Public sector, highly-confidential industries (e.g. automotive, pharma), other cloud-service providers</li>
<li>Profiles: CTOs, research/engineering department leads</li>
</ul>
<h2>Smart test setup for extra insights</h2>
<p>Prospects should discover the service through ads on LinkedIn or tech blogs. A click leads to a landing page with optional topic subpages, convincing to fill out a contact form.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/experiment-design.png" alt="A diagram of the user flow between the ads, website pages and other parts of the experiment: 1. Ad, 2. Landing page, 3. USP subpage (2 options: Green, EU-sovereign), 4. Tech subpage (3 options: Normal, AI, HPC), 5. Contact form, 6. Calendly meeting booking tool, 7. Interview via video call, 8. LOI "></p>
<p class="img-description">Different ads and subpages let us measure what prospects are interested in</p>
<h4>Details for extra insights:</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 ad versions, to compare click-through rates of the &quot;sustainability&quot; and &quot;EU sovereignity&quot; value propositions</li>
<li>Subpages for the 2 value propositions, for the same reason</li>
<li>Subpages for 3 hardware configurations, to inform investment decision</li>
</ul>
<p>We would then use Calendly to schedule a video call, through which the client project lead would try to get one of 3 LOIs.</p>
<h2>Creating a 6-page website in just 2 weeks</h2>
<p>The project plan included only 2 weeks to design the ads and the whole website. I managed to meet the timeline with a structured process from low to high fidelity:</p>
<p>Being specific with the brand helped to make visual design decisions faster and to prevent subjective discussions about taste:
<img src="/assets/img-brand-chart.png" alt="A coordinate system of different brand directions, with &quot;Fancy&quot; on the top, &quot;Friendly&quot; on the right, &quot;Quirky&quot; on the bottom, &quot;Techie&quot; on the right, and &quot;Clean/Simple&quot; in the middle. A dashed box highlights the intended brand area between &quot;Techie&quot; and &quot;Clean/Simple&quot;."></p>
<p class="img-description">For this tech service, a slightly technical brand makes sense.</p>
<h3>Stocking up fast on visual assets</h3>
<p>To create an appealing visual design despite few available assets, I combined the provided windpark pictures with free, versatile vector graphics and a dot pattern to prototype a consistent-enough visual design that fits the technical topic.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/visual-design.png" alt="An overview of visual asset elements (Wind &amp; solar park pictures, Stock pictures, Dot pattern, Green color, Vector graphics, Icons) and 2 options of a combination of these elements: 1. 2 overlaying pictures (windmill, data center interior) above a dot pattern, 2. An outline of Germany, above that outlines of server hardware and icons and labels marking 3 sites of wind- and solar parks"></p>
<p class="img-description">Combining free & versatile assets to achieve a consistent, fitting brand.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/landing-page.png" alt="Screenshots of the landing page: Left the desktop version, to the right the mobile version."></p>
<p class="img-description">Combining all content in a responsive website</p>
<h2>Clear test results &amp; extra effort</h2>
<p>With 4 weeks duration and 3000€ budget for LinkedIn and Google ads, we got these results:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/funnel.png" alt="Diagram of the conversion funnel: 1. 100000 ad impressions, with 0,3% click-through rate to 2. 300 visits, with 4% conversion to 3. 12 sign-ups, with 0% conversion to 4. 0 interviews, then 5. LOIs"></p>
<p class="img-description">None of the 3 required LOIs could be generated through the test</p>
<p>Instead of analyzing the details of such a clear result, we analyzed if we chose the wrong channel to sell an otherwise desirable idea.</p>
<h3>Extra mile: Adding another channel</h3>
<p>On a cloud tech trade fair in Frankfurt, we conducted quick interviews with industry experts to get qualitative insights about the desirability of our service.</p>
<h4>Key insights:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Customers would not choose our client over established cloud providers to run their (business-critical) cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Using renewable energy is already commoditized, and directly used renewable energy is not perceived better than when certificates are used → no differentiation</li>
<li>EU sovereignty needed to be thought holistically: To stand out, a company had to refrain from any servers overseas – including those used to run the internal CMS, video conferencing and email.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Clear result, plus a way forward</h2>
<p>The venture idea failed to induce 3 LOIs, disproving its desirability. Albeit not being the favored outcome, this 12-week project managed to enable an decision on more than 10 Mio. € of investment for a venture idea that stagnated internally for multiple years.</p>
<p>Turning away from cloud infrastructure, colocation showed potential:</p>
<p class="text-highlight"><span>Offering data centers without the cost-intensive hardware and hyperscaler competition, while keeping the venture's energy component.</span></p>
<p>This left the venture idea's lead, convinced by the validity of the insights that he co-created with us, with a potential path ahead.</p>
