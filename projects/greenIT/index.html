        <h1>Market-testing a cloud venture idea</h1>
    </span>
</div>
<!--<p class="description nda">(This project is under NDA, its content is generalized)</p>-->
<h2>From wind parks to data centers</h2>
<p>In this 12-week project, a German energy corporation asked us to validate an ambitious venture idea:</p>
<p class="text-highlight"><span>Powering energy-intensive cloud computing services directly with energy from their own wind and solar parks, and selling them to other businesses.</span></p>
<p>The project lead was pushing for an investment, while the other stakeholders saw too much uncertainty. Eva (lead innovation consultant) and I were brought in to enable a decision.</p>
<h2>Big market, strong competition</h2>
<p>70-90% of the 100 Bn. € European cloud market is dominated by the seemingly invincible hyperscalers AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. But the outlook that only 1% of the non-hyperscaler market are worth 100 Mio. €, was a sufficient perspective to pursue this opportunity.</p>

<p class="img-description">1% of the non-hyperscaler market is worth 100 Mio. €</p>
<h2>Hypotheses &amp; alignment on a goal</h2>
<p>In order to be successful, the venture idea needed to fulfill the following 3 high-level hypotheses:</p>
<h4>1. Feasible: We are capable to provide this service</h4>
<p>Out of scope for this project, as the client's project lead explored the idea's feasibility in depth before this project.</p>
<h4>2. Viable: We can offer this service for an attractive price</h4>
<p>To validate this element, Eva collaborated with an external business analyst to calculate a business case with different scenarios.</p>
<h4>3. Desirable: We can convince customers to buy the cloud service</h4>
<p>To validate this element, we conducted a fake door test: We created a landing page prototype to test how attractive the service would be to real prospects.</p>
<p>In the project kickoff, we agreed with our stakeholders on the goal of 3 customer letters of intent (LOI): If we managed to get 3 customers declaring their purchase interest in a LOI, we would perceive the desirability to be validated.</p>
<h2>Research: Who is buying, and why?</h2>
<p>To use the right keywords in our test, we researched which value propositions our competitors used to market their cloud services. While value propositions using one or two of the values sustainability, high performance, and EU-sovereignty are already occupied, the combination of the three values seemed attractive for our positioning.
<img src="/assets/value-propositions.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">A combination of 3 value propositions gives a niche in the market</p>
<h4>Customer segments &amp; buyer profiles</h4>
<p>To target the right people with our advertisement budget, we developed a rough set of customer segments and buyer profiles, utilizing the project lead's experience and supporting desk research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer segments: Public sector, highly-confidential industries (e.g. automotive, pharma), other cloud-service providers</li>
<li>Profiles: CTOs, research/engineering department leads</li>
</ul>
<h2>Smart test setup for extra insights</h2>
<p>After clicking on a Google or LinkedIn ad for the service, the ideal prospects go through a landing page and optional subpages before filling out a contact form. We included:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 ad versions, to compare click-through rates of the &quot;sustainability&quot; and &quot;EU sovereignity&quot; value propositions</li>
<li>Subpages for the 2 value propositions</li>
<li>Subpages for 3 hardware configurations, to inform investment decision</li>
</ul>
<p>We would then use Calendly to schedule a video call, through which the client project lead would try to get one of 3 LOIs.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/experiment-design.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Different ads and subpages let us measure what prospects are interested in</p>
<h2>Creating a 6-page website in just 2 weeks</h2>
<p>The project plan included only 2 weeks to design the ads and the whole website. I managed to meet the timeline with a structured process from lo- to hi-fidelity:</p>
<p>Being specific with the brand helped to make visual design decisions faster and to prevent subjective discussions about taste:

A dashed box highlights the intended brand area between &quot;Techie&quot; and &quot;Clean/Simple&quot;."></p>
<p class="img-description">For this tech service, a slightly technical brand makes sense.</p>
<p>Visual design is an important element in making a landing page appealing, but there were little visual assets available. As a solution, I combined what was available with free, versatile vector graphics and a dot pattern to prototype a consistent-enough visual design that fits the technical topic.

<p class="img-description">Combining all content in a responsive website</p>
<h2>Clear test results &amp; extra effort</h2>
<p>With 4 weeks duration and 3000€ budget for LinkedIn and Google ads, we got these results:</p>
<ul>
<li>ca. 100k ad impressions</li>
<li>ca. 300 clicks</li>
<li>12 signups – all of which were spam</li>
</ul>
<p>With such a clear result, we skipped analyzing the details and used the available time to eliminate the chance we chose the wrong channel to sell a desirable idea.</p>
<h3>Qualitative interviews at the Cloud Expo</h3>
<p>My colleague Markus and I visited a cloud computing trade fair in Frankfurt a. M. and conducted quick interviews with industry experts to assess the desirability of the 3 different value propositions sustainability, EU-sovereignty and high performance.</p>
<h4>Key insights:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Customers would not choose our client over established cloud providers to run their (business-critical) cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Using renewable energy is already commoditized, and directly used renewable energy is not perceived better than when certificates are used → no differentiation</li>
<li>EU sovereignty needed to be thought holistically: To stand out, a company had to refrain from any servers overseas – including those used to run the internal CMS, video conferencing and email.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Clear result, plus an opportunity to pivot</h2>
<p>The venture idea failed to induce 3 LOIs, which disprove its desirability. Additionally, the business case showed a necessary investment of more than 10 Mio. €, otherwise looking viable with the right demand.</p>
<p>In the last week before the final presentation, we could convince the project lead, who was focused on this venture idea for multiple years, to consider offering colocation services: Less profit, but also saving 90% investment related to cloud hardware, avoiding the competition with hyperscalers, and being closer to the company's core strength: Energy.</p>
<p>Key here was involving the project lead in the project, experiment and insights, to get his buy-in for the pivot.</p>
