<h2>Extending a cross-device feature</h2>
<p>As a UX designer, I was working in 2 feature teams of our client, a German car company, improving their mobile app. One team owned the feature to update the car's firmware via phone, and the latest generation cars enabled the starting and following installations by phone – functionality that should be designed and implemented in the companion app.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/feature-flow.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">The firmware update flow, to be extended with new functionality.</p>
<h2>Creating a clear framing first</h2>
<p>The start was confusing, as the product owner (PO) already created a UX concept to speed up the implementation. Also, some improvements were included.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/PO-concept.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Screenshot of the UX concept prepared by my product owner</p>
<p>Not being familiar with the feature yet, I first sorted the information in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business and customer goals</li>
<li>Technical requirements for new functionality</li>
<li>Ideas for new functionality</li>
<li>Improvements for existing part</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fostering a productive relationship</h2>
<p>The PO's emphasis on speed and corner-cutting was competing with the need for creating the necessary UX quality. To align our styles of working more, I first assessed the rationals behind the time pressure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upcoming &quot;Christmas Testing&quot; where new functionality is showcased to senior management</li>
<li>Delays caused by other designers in the past, who struggled with the team's highly-technical topics</li>
<li>Full feature pipeline, therefore interest to start earlier with the next feature</li>
</ol>
<p>The following activities reassured the PO of our progress, and unlocked a collaborative style of work:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the start, making progress visible to increase PO's trust: Requirements &amp; designs accessible on Confluence, weekly sharing sessions</li>
<li>Collaborating closely with PO &amp; tech lead to understand technical limitations and possibilities</li>
<li>Using customer and business goals to guide discussions and compromises</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business goals VS. user goals</h2>
<p>There are 1 main and 2 fallback options for users to update their car's firmware. The promoted option utilizes the user's phone to download the update files, saving the corporation extra cost for network traffic.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/installation-option-I.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Option I: A 3-step process using your phone</p>
<p>However, I expected the update to be downloaded &quot;Over-The-Air&quot; (OTA) which is the fallback option, and a bounce rate of 50% on the &quot;Connect to car&quot; screen confirmed that I am not the only one confused.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/installation-option-II.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Option II: OTA updates directly to your car</p>
<p>While OTA updates are convenient for users, it comes with an average of 5€ cellular costs per update for the manufacturer – amounting to over 1M€ due to the fleet's scale. And if users don't update either way, then the car will be updated during the next workshop visit, costing the manufacturer 100€ per installation.</p>
<h2>Clarity for users through visual design</h2>
<p>The data shows that the process is not intuitive, and needed to be explained better. I involved my UI design colleague earlier than usual for this project, and we co-designed the optimal way to communicate the process, current step and required user actions in a clear and consistent visual appearance.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/feature-flow-visual-element.png" alt="&lt;!-- TODO alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Consistent visual design & clear status indicators (visuals under NDA)</p>
<h2>Evangelizing for usability</h2>
<p>Copying the car's update flow, as in the PO's concept, to reduce implementation efforts entails UX problems: When starting an update in the car, installation blockers like a low battery or an open door are shown next so users can fix the issue.
<img src="/assets/blueprint-car-only.png" alt="&lt;!--TODO: alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Installation states in the car</p>
<p><img src="/assets/blueprint-PO-concept.png" alt="&lt;!--TODO: alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">PO's concept based on technical state model</p>
<p>Blockers are not shown before starting an installation, which – in the mobile app – creates a disappointing experience when users see the &quot;Start update&quot; button and only learn after clicking that one of 16 issues is blocking the installation.</p>
<p>It was necessary to work closely together with the PO and tech lead to assess what is technically possible, and to convince the PO to invest into adjusting the technical flow albeit the time pressure, to achieve this small change in the user flow:

<p class="img-description">Checking for blockers in the latest transmitted car state, to show the right step</p>
<h2>Getting the design to 100%</h2>
<p>For the technical side, I collaborated closely with the PO and tech lead: We discovering dozens of edge cases and searched optimal compromises between implementation effort, and usability and delight.</p>
<p>For design excellence, I gathered feedback from the project's design team in an insightful review format.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/design-review.png" alt="&lt;!--TODO: alt text --&gt;"></p>
<p class="img-description">Results from the design team review</p>
<p>We then tested the design in a scheduled usability test with 12 external people, to detect remaining unclear details in the flow.</p>
